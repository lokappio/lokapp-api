# Roles

When inviting a user to collaborate with you on a project, you have to specify its role.

The new user's role can be one of the following:
- owner
- manager
- editor
- translator

## Owner

The default role given to the user creating a project. This user can do everything on a project: managing users, languages, translations, and even deleting the whole project.

The deletion of a project can only be done by its owner.

## Manager

A _manager_, as the _owner_, can do everything on a project, except deleting a project. 

## Editor

An _editor_ can't edit the project or its user, but can manage languages, groups and translations of a project. 

## Translator

A _translator_ is the role with the less permissions and can only manage translation values.

A user with this role isn't allowed to edit translation keys or languages.
