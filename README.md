#### Roles and invitations

Manage your users and who can access to your projects.

## API Documentation

You can find the API documentation of the API on [Bump.sh](https://bump.sh/lokapp/hub/lokapp/doc/lokapp-api)

Locally, you can access the Swagger documentation once the API is up and running at [http://localhost:5000/api/documentation](http://localhost:5000/api/documentation/#/).

## Usage

While the API is running, you can create any client to interact with the API or play with [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to call the diffrent endpoints.

### Authentication

The majority of the endpoints require you to be autenticated to access it. To do so, you need to provide a token within the `Authorization` header of the request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

See the [Authentication](documentation/authentication.md) documentation to learn more about the current authentication.
